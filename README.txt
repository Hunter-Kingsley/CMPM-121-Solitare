Its Lazy Solitare! There is a draw pile you can pull from where all the cards start face down. Because I wasnt able to get the cards to snap to the relative position of the card holders yet, the game isnt immedalty set up for you, but the logic I would use is there (the same logic that lets me pull from the draw pile now is how the starting piles are gonna work). I could have just manually placed cards there with no underlying logic just for the sake of the rubric, but that felt kinda like cheating. You can also stack cards and split piles seamlessly!

The first programming pattern I implemented was the subclass. I thought that because the deck pile and the card holders both shared the purpose of being able to hold cards and pick up cards from them, it would be usefull to implement the base class holder, then have the deck class inherit from it. This was nice because the holder class has couple functions and a parameter that deck needed and I was able to just use them without duplicating any code. I could also argue that I used a pseudo state machine for all of the cards. Having those states was super important for not only the picking-up and placing of cards, but also differentiating where and how a card was in a stack so I could cover all the edge cases and make the stacking and splitting as nice and easy as possible. Overall I'm proud of how the stacking turned out. It's intuitive, not buggy, and very similar to how it's implemented in official realeases of the game. The worst aspect of it I think is readability and polish. It works just fine, but I dont think the people in my section on monday are gonna have the slighest clue what going on. Taking a couple passes to put thoughtfull commenets around tricky logic and cleaning up small redundant code snippets could go a long way here.
