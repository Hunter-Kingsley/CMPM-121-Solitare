Im gonna keep it real, I have not been able to work on this since the Monday section. I am in the Game Dev club (GDA) and have spent all week working on the playtest build for our playtest happening tonight. I'm really proud of that work I did for that, so if it will make you feel more merciful, I can go to Zac's office hours (or yours if you happen to be zac) and show you. Anyways, I WILL have this done before the end of the day next Friday (4/25/2025 11:59pm).

Thank you,

Hunter Kingsley

(P.S. please forgive me this wont happen again ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­)
